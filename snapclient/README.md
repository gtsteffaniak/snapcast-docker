# Snapcast Client

This readme describe the various ways to use snapcast client (snapclient).
This requires a running snapcast server (snapserver). View 
[snapserver](../snapserver/README.md) for more information.

## Snapcast Client
* can be started two ways:
   * via bootstrap.sh
   * via docker-compose.yml
* multiple arch files
   * arm64
   * arm32
   * amd64
   * or build your own
* bluetooth support
   * Requires compatible hardware
   * Requires host to be running working firmware
* pulseaudio 15 (using latest gtstef/snapclient)
* bluez 5.60    (using latest gtstef/snapclient)

* Snapclient sets up audio node that can output audio to linux device connected to a wired audio output OR bluetooth speaker.
* Using bluetooth speaker is a single command that includes a docker container which automatically pairs to the bluetooth device and sets up the client and config.

## How to use

You can either use the bootstrap.sh or docker-compose.

1. Using bootstrap.sh (client init):
   * Firstly, get the server running, either of the following options:
      * (preferred) navigate to `./snapserver` and initiate `docker-compose up -d`
      * or use `docker run` by running `docker run -d --net host -v '/var/run/avahi-daemon/socket:/var/run/avahi-daemon/socket' -name snapserver gtstef/snapserver`
   * Run `./bootstrap.sh`, examples
      * `./bootstrap.sh -n my-wireless-speaker -d 14:C1:4E:B3:D0:D9 -h snapserver-ip-or-hostname `
      * `./bootstrap.sh -n local-audio -h localhost `
```
usage: ./bootstrap.sh
   flags:
        -n [name of client speaker]
   optional:
        -d [bluetooth mac]
        -r (specifies to remove/recreate existing container)
        -i (specifies instance/ip... fix ip conflicts)
        -h snapserver ip/hostame manual assignment
        -v version of docker image (leave blank for latest)
        -m disable stereo ( enable for mono bt speaker)

examples:
        # create single client local speaker device (ie: headphone jack speaker)
        ./bootstrap.sh -n my-speaker
        # create bluetooth speaker (will begin pairing process)
        ./bootstrap.sh -n my-wireless-speaker -d 14:C1:4E:B3:D0:D9
```
 1. Using docker-compose:
   * Update docker-compose host to match your environment
   * run `docker-compose up -d` on main directory
